Now its time to set up API routes (TRPC routers)
- Write all required routers
- Write requirement outline, inputs, calls, output for each router
- Use TRPC middleware

- Make Supabase RLS policies
- Add access functionality to API

____________________________________________________________________


Time Suckers
- Server side authentication with helpers and context injection
- Authentication error (strictMode)
- TRPC backend router layout
- TRPC middleware vs context injection (for user extraction)
- Request throttling (with context)


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[TRPC]
# Where is TRPC object created?			s/trpc.ts
# What is TRPC object added to?
	it is not directly added
	it has a create router fn and procedure
	create router is used to create parent router, which is added to NextApiHandler
	procedure is used to create routers
# What inputs does NextApiHandler take?		parent router, context creation fn
# Where is context creation function written?	s/trpc.ts
# Where is context creation function added?	to NextApiHandler
# Where is NextApiHandler created		p/trpc/[trpc].ts
# Where is parent router created?		s/root.ts
# Where to write new routers? 			s/routers/<name>.ts
# Where to add new routers? 			to parent router
# Where to write new middleware?		s/trpc.ts
# Where to connect middleware to procedure?	s/trpc.ts
# Where to write new procedures?		s/trpc.ts
# Where to add new procedures?			already added to TRPC object
# What is the use of procedures?		router creation

1 context → 1 parent router → 'x' routers
1 router → 'y' procedures
1 procedure → 'z' middlewares
Only 1 context for every router, but any number of middlewares

> context: attaching objects
> middleware: filtering requests (based on attached or fetched info)
> procedures: performing operations

Middleware building flow
- Make a middleware
- Add it to public procedure to create a new (restricted) procedure
- Use (restricted) procedure to create new (restricted) routers

What TRPC gives
- Server side routing
- Server side middleware
- Autocomplete
- Easy fetch calls

What to use it for
- Complex db operations, which require lots of validation ops
- Platform wide operations (e.g. get all products for homepage)
- Forced limited operations (throttling, max fetch count etc)

# Should I use client side library?
# Should I make independent api route for cookie setting?
# What should I change the inner context input type to?
# What server ops should I handle outside of trpc?
   - Authentication
   - Cookie setting
   - Next middleware, serversideprops & staticprops
   - Simple client-db calls (access based match/filter CRUD - use with ZOD)

Method 1: Minimal TRPC
> The best way to use TRPC is to try as much as possible to not use it
> Because force fitting everything into TRPC becomes a huge burden
> Just replace fetch calls with TRPC, for everything else, useQuery

Method 2: Maximal TRPC
> Perform all server operations through TRPC
> Only don't use TRPC where you can't access it (e.g. serversideprops)
> Use it for boundary operations like auth, cookie setting, db calls


		Pro			Con
Method 1	Fast dev		Messy /lib
Method 2	Uniform DX		++latency, ++serverless cost, fighting client libraries

> Zod is more important to master than TRPC, because it integrates into your work, not vice versa
> Combination of these 4 libraries in right proportions => a great product in the least time

[Auth]
Integration flow
- Add global zus auth-state
- Add set cookie API route
- Add auth button and logic
- useEffect, []
   - Add user checker function
	- Set auth-state
   - Add supabase auth listener
	- auth-state set
   	- Cookie set
   	- Router push
   - Cleanup unsub
- Add auth-state based UI
- Add auth guard middleware

Auth setting in 4 places
✖ initial DB call
✔ user action
✔ listener
✖ effect
Use zus to store info(update with listener), don't rely on supabase client


[Templating]
Things you make
- hooks (will contain store, external calls, initialiser)
- lib
- middlewares
- routers
- context

Pattern
- Every entity (not action) in app (e.g. User, Cart) has a custom hook
- The hook can have a store, internal logic, or external API calls
- Every hook has an init function, which manages LS call, initial DB call, listener attachment
- Init functions are called by useInit hook only, not the hook itself
- If init functions are interdependent (e.g. user→cart), then waterfall init return values
- All init functions are async

Form Logic Variants
> Checked
   - on submit		(errors by zod path)
   - dynamically	(errors in custom vars)
   - server side	(errors via alerts)
> Values Recording
   - in form		(form data via prop 'name')
   - in form customised (nested on sub)
   - custom vars 	(appended to form on sub)
> Error Reporting
   - zod field name
   - obj property name	(arrays)

• Arrays matched by property name, no need for dynamic zod names
Element names → data → validated against Schema → Error object paths acc to schema → Error paths converted to flat Map of errors → Elements have errors matching the name structure by convention
